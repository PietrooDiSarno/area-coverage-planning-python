    This function handles the processing of an observation point by computing
    its footprint, updating the list of completed observations and adjusting
    the remaining area to be covered. It also accounts for anti-meridian
    interception and updates the time for the next observation based on slew
    rate and observation time.

    Programmers:  Paula Betriu (UPC/ESEIAAT)
    Date:         09/2023

    Usage:        A, tour, fpList, poly1,t = processObservation(A, tour,
                  fpList, poly1, t, slewRate, tobs, amIntercept, inst sc, target,
                  resolution)

    Inputs:
      > A:           list of lists of successive instrument observations,
                     sorted in chronological order.
                     Each observation is defined by the instrument boresight
                     projection onto the body surface, in latitudinal
                     coordinates [lon lat], in deg
     > tour:         array of remaining observation points in the tour, in
                     latitudinal coordinates [ยบ]
     > fpList:       list of footprint structures detailing the observation
                     metadata and coverage
     > poly1:        current polygon shape of the uncovered area on the
                     target body
     > t:            current time in ephemeris seconds past J2000 epoch
     > slewRate:     rate at which the spacecraft (or instrument platform)
                     can slew between observations, in [ยบ/s]
     > tobs:         observation time, i.e. the minimum time that the
                     instrument needs to perform an observation, in seconds
     > amIntercept:  boolean flag indicating if the anti-meridian is
                     intercepted by the observation path
     > inst:         string name of the instrument
     > sc:           string name of the spacecraft
     > target:       string name of the target body
     > resolution:   string defining the resolution setting, affecting the
                     footprint calculation. It could be either 'lowres' or
                     'highres'. See footprint function for further
                     information
