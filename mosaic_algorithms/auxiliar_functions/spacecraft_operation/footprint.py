def footprint(t, inst, sc, target, res, *args):
    """
    Given the spacecraft trajectory, this function computes the FOV
    projection onto the body surface, i.e., the footprint. The spacecraft
    orientation is determined by the lon, lat, and theta angles.
    Assumption: the FOV is rectangular.
    Note: this function is contained in the framework of the automated
    scheduler that optimizes the observation plan of a mission according to
    a set of scientific objectives.
    [Warning]: limb projections on a topographical map might be very
    irregular. FUTURE WORK

    Programmers:  Paula Betriu (UPC/ESEIAAT)
    Date:         10/2022
    Version:      2
    Last update:  12/2023

    Usage:        fp = footprint(t, inst, sc, target, res)
                  fp = footprint(t, inst, sc, target, res, lon, lat)
    Inputs:
      > t:        time epoch in TDB seconds past J2000 epoch
      > inst:     string SPICE name of the instrument
      > sc:       string SPICE name of the spacecraft
      > target:   string SPICE name of the target body
      > lon:      longitude coordinate of the target body at which the
                  instrument boresight is pointing, in [deg]
      > lat:      latitude coordinate of the target body at which the
                  instrument boresight is pointing, in [deg]

    Outputs:
      > fp:       struct containing main parameters of the footprint. In this
                  case, only the field 'vertices' is necessary.
