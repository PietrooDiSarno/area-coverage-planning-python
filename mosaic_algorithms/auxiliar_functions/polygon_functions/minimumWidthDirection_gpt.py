def minimumWidthDirection(x, y):
    """
    This function computes the orientation (angle) at which the width of the
    polygon is minimized. It also calculates the minimum width, the height
    (assuming the minimum width as the base), and the direction vector (axes)
    of the minimum width.

    Usage:        thetamin, minwidth, height, axes = minimumWidthDirection(x, y)

    Inputs:
      > x:            array of x-coordinates of the polygon vertices
      > y:            array of y-coordinates of the polygon vertices

    Outputs:
      > thetamin:     angle at which polygon's width is minimized, in [deg]
      > minwidth:     minimum width of the polygon
      > height:       height of the polygon, at the orientation specified by
                      thetamin and assuming minwidth as the base
      > axes:         unit vector representing the direction of the polygon
